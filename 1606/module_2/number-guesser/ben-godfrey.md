### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

- 2+  --> Seriously thought toward refactoring but still keeping code in two giant components. Unnecessary data in state and significant repetition in code.
  - Feel like after working through project refactoring would be way better

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
