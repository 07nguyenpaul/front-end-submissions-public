### Functional Expectations

- 3+ Only functionality missing was disabling of buttons which didn't work because of a typo

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three
- 3: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two



### Fundamental JavaScript/React Style

- One giant function
- 2: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
