# Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
2 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outline in the specification above.
1 - The application is missing 3 or more smaller features or 1 major feature essential to having a complete application.
0 - The application is unusable.

# User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

Note: the task and break time inputs gets too small on mobile, not unusable, but needs some adjustment.

# HTML Style

2.75 - a little overly enthusiastic with adding wrapping elements, made it difficult to read, and likely difficult to incorporate layout adjustments down the road/ would be tricky to maintain.

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
2: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

# CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

# JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
1 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
0 - Your client-side application does not function or the application does not make use of localStorage for updating information on the client. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.

# Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

# Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
2 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
1 - The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
0 - The application was not checked into version control.

# Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints
1 - More than ten complaints

# Design

3.5 - just needs little tightening up, rethink color choices for the break count down

<!-- 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement. -->
