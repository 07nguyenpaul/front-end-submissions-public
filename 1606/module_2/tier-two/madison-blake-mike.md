## Tier Two - Gains
# Instructor: Louisa
# Student: Madison, Blake, Mike
# notes:

Really lovely design and great product idea, needed more time to really finish the UI and make a polished MVP.

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

4 - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. The application shows evidence that the developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.
3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.
2 - The application shows some effort to incorporate ideas and concepts from the last two weeks of instruction, but is structured in a way that makes it hard to adapt and change approaches. There is some evidence that the developers considered what additional features and functionality the user might need.
1 - The application does the bare minimum it needs to and shows little or no influence by topics and approaches covered in the two weeks of instruction from when the project started. The project shows no evidence that the developers considered the user in implementing the features in the application.

## Design

3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.


## User Interface

2.5 - feels very in-process, if it gets tightened up by monday will adjust score.

<!-- 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories. -->

## HTML Style

4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.


## JavaScript Style

4 - Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
2 - Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.
1 - Your application has a significant amount of duplication and one or more major bugs. Developer cannot speak to most choices and does not know what every line of code is doing.
0 - Your client-side application does not function or the application does not make use of localStorage for updating information on the client. Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity.

## Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application. The testing in this project shows that the students dedicated themselves to overcoming obstacles and figure out how to test parts of the application that were otherwise “hard to test.”
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.
2 - Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
1 - There is little or no evidence of testing in this application.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
2 - The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.
1 - The developer committed the code to version control in only a few commits. The evaluator cannot determine the evolution of the application.
0 - The application was not checked into version control.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

4 - Zero complaints
3 - Five or fewer complaints
2 - Six to ten complaints
1 - More than ten complaints
