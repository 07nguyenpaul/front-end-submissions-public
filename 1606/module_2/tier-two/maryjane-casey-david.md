# notes:

## Specification Adherence

3 - No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## Risk Taking and Creativity

3 - The project shows that the developers carefully considered their approach and were able to implement concepts taught over the last two weeks. The application shows evidence that developers dug deep into documentation for the technologies they used and experimented with different approaches.

## Design

4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.
3 - The application has a strong approach to layout and content hierarchy, but typography and color choices are lacking. The evaluator has several recommended changes to improvement.
2 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices show effort, but the result is not effective. The evaluator recommends significant changes.
1 - Layout, content hierarchy, typography, and color choices actively detract from the user’s ability to use the application.

## User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. The application is fully responsive, and has clearly had special consideration around usability on devices. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
2 - The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is not effective. The evaluator has some difficulty using the application when reviewing the features in the user stories.
1 - The application is confusing or difficult to use.

## HTML Style

2.5: Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

## CSS/Sass Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

## JavaScript Style

Soft 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application has robust unit tests and makes some use of feature testing where appropriate and applicable.

## Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…

3 - Five or fewer complaints
